# baseball-interface
I would like to create a UI using React that allows me to interact with different players stats in the MLB. The stats will most likley be derived from BaseballReference and Baseball Savant. <br>
<br>
Simple things to start with: <br>
Display triple slash line for Bryce Harper in 2024 <br>
- Not completed <br>
Create a small database of players, and make it so you can click on different players to view their statistics <br>
- Not completed <br>
Create a sort method that sorts by a certain stat by ascending or descending order
- Not compelted <br>
-

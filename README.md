# baseball-interface
The idea of this project is to create a UI using React that allows people to interact with different players' stats in the MLB. The stats will likely be derived from BaseballReference and Baseball Savant. <br>
<br>
Simple things to start with: <br>
Display triple slash line for Bryce Harper in 2024 (Not completed) <br>
Create a small database of players, and make it so you can click on different players to view their statistics (Not completed) <br>
Create a sort method that sorts by a certain stat by ascending or descending order (Not completed) <br>

Normalize and store in the database <br> 

### 3. Backend Development: 
Set up routes, controllers, and services <br> 
Create a robust error-handling and validation system <br> 

### 4. Frontend Development: 
Create reusable components (e.g., tables, cards, filters) <br>
Connect to backend via API calls <br> 
Add routing and state management (e.g., Context API or Redux) <br> 

### 5. Deploy: 
Use services like Vercel/Netlify for the frontend <br>
Host the backend on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Railway <br> 
Use Docker for easier deployment <br> 

## 4. Tools/Technologies: 
Frontend: React, TailwingCSS/Material-UI, Chart.js <br>
